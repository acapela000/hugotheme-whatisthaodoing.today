Yo! What's up, tech world! With a basic input, chatGPT helped me have a cool self-introduction.Here it is! 
I'm a newbie here and I'm absolutely loving it. My first love is Java and I love how versatile and powerful it is. It's got so many possibilities. Currently, I'm exploring TypeScript and I'm stoked to see where this journey takes me!

One thing I'm particularly passionate about is security. Lately, I've even been dabbling in some hacking challenges, just to see if I can spot any weaknesses in my own code. It's wild!

Even though IT isn't my first major, I know it's going to be my lifelong companion. I mean, how can I not be excited about the ever-changing and evolving world of technology? I'm stoked to be a part of it and can't wait to see what the future holds.
